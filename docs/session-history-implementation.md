# Unified Session History + In-Route Summary Modal Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation for:
1. Unified session persistence across Classic, Blitz, and Gauntlet game modes.
2. In-route (non-route-changing) session summary UX after session end/quit.
3. Manual quit (`X`) behavior consistency across game modes.

All work was implemented in `C:\Users\reser\kanadojo`.

## Goals Implemented

### 1. Unified session history persistence (localforage)
A new persistent session-history module was added to store game sessions in one centralized localforage object.

- File added: `shared/lib/sessionHistory.ts`
- Storage key: `kanadojo-session-history-v1`
- Supports:
  - Session lifecycle: start -> append attempts -> finalize
  - Modes: `classic | blitz | gauntlet`
  - Dojos: `kana | kanji | vocabulary`
  - End reasons: `completed | failed | manual_quit | navigation_exit | unload_exit`

#### Stored session shape (high level)
- Session identity and metadata
- Start/end timestamps and duration
- End semantics (`endedReason`, `endedAbruptly`)
- Selection context (`selectedSets`, `selectedCount`, `route`)
- Session summary (`correct`, `wrong`, `accuracy`, `bestStreak`, `stars`, `totalAttempts`)
- Full attempt array (`AttemptEvent[]`)
- Mode payload (`modePayload`)

#### Public API implemented
- `startSession(...)`
- `appendAttempt(sessionId, attempt)`
- `finalizeSession(...)`

---

### 2. Blitz flow updates

- File updated: `shared/components/Blitz/index.tsx`
- File updated: `shared/components/Blitz/ResultsScreen.tsx`

#### Changes made
- Added session lifecycle integration:
  - Start session at challenge start (auto-start and manual start paths)
  - Append attempt events for both Type and Pick interactions
  - Finalize session on timer completion (`endedReason: completed`)
  - Finalize session on manual quit (`endedReason: manual_quit`, abrupt)
- Added safeguards to prevent duplicate finalization.
- Manual `X` no longer immediately navigates away; it now ends the session and shows summary.
- Results header now adapts copy for natural completion vs manual quit.

#### UX behavior now
- `New Session` (`Try Again`) remains on same `/blitz` route.
- `Back` navigates to dojo selection route.

---

### 3. Gauntlet flow updates

- File updated: `shared/components/Gauntlet/index.tsx`
- File updated: `shared/components/Gauntlet/ResultsScreen.tsx`

#### Changes made
- Integrated unified session lifecycle:
  - Start session when gauntlet starts
  - Append attempt events during answer submission
  - Finalize on natural completion/failure
  - Finalize on manual quit in active play
- Manual quit in active phase now triggers finalization + results view instead of immediate exit.
- Added ended-reason-aware UI text in results (`Victory`, `Game Over`, `Session Ended`).
- Works in both route and modal gauntlet contexts.

#### UX behavior now
- Summary stays in current gauntlet context.
- Restart starts a new session in-place.
- Navigation out only occurs when user chooses it.

---

### 4. Classic `/train` in-route quit summary modal

- File added: `shared/components/Game/ClassicSessionSummary.tsx`
- File updated: `shared/components/Game/ReturnFromGame.tsx`
- File updated: `features/Kana/components/Game/index.tsx`
- File updated: `features/Kanji/components/Game/index.tsx`
- File updated: `features/Vocabulary/components/Game/index.tsx`

#### Changes made
- Replaced immediate-exit behavior from `ReturnFromGame` with callback-based quit handling.
- `X` now:
  1. Saves existing classic stats (`saveSession()` behavior preserved).
  2. Finalizes unified session history entry.
  3. Opens new in-route summary modal.
- Added `ClassicSessionSummary` modal with two explicit actions:
  - `Back to Selection`
  - `New Session`

#### UX behavior now (as requested)
- Summary is part of current `/train` route state (not a separate route).
- `New Session` keeps user on same game route.
- `Back to Selection` navigates to corresponding dojo menu route.

## File Change List

### Added
- `shared/lib/sessionHistory.ts`
- `shared/components/Game/ClassicSessionSummary.tsx`

### Modified
- `shared/components/Blitz/index.tsx`
- `shared/components/Blitz/ResultsScreen.tsx`
- `shared/components/Gauntlet/index.tsx`
- `shared/components/Gauntlet/ResultsScreen.tsx`
- `shared/components/Game/ReturnFromGame.tsx`
- `features/Kana/components/Game/index.tsx`
- `features/Kanji/components/Game/index.tsx`
- `features/Vocabulary/components/Game/index.tsx`

---

## Validation Performed

### TypeScript
- Command: `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`
- Result: Passed.

### ESLint (targeted changed files)
- Command run on all touched files.
- Result: No errors.
- Note: One warning remains from existing Blitz `console.log` usage in goal timer code path.

## Known Follow-up (optional hardening)
Classic mode now has robust session finalization and in-route summary behavior. Full per-attempt event capture has been integrated for Blitz/Gauntlet, while Classic currently finalizes from aggregate session state in route-level handlers. If needed, a follow-up can add exhaustive `appendAttempt(...)` calls into every Classic Pick/Input/WordBuilding answer handler for parity.

## Commit Scope
This implementation commit includes:
- Unified persistence module
- Blitz + Gauntlet manual quit summary and save consistency
- Classic in-route summary modal and routing behavior
- Session finalization wiring in all three dojos
